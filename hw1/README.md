# Assignment 1

## Test

Please `make` on **host** in `test/` to build the test tools, because the guest doesn't have the ability to compile.

Run `test/test.sh` on **guest** to test the module. You should be able to run the script in any directory. If you failed to run the script, please `cd` to `test` directory before running the script.
